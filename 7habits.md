# The 7 habits of successful journalists

The following is a list of 7 habits that I believe the best journalism demonstrates, and good journalists develop. These are not 'personal qualities' that "cannot be taught": those that promote this view of journalism are, I believe, either demonstrating arrogance in saying so, or laziness in failing to see that these qualities can, and are, taught around the world outside of journalism education.

The first 4 habits relate primarily to newsgathering: they are qualities that help journalists to see stories where others do not, to collect the information required, and treat it appropriately.

The other 3 habits relate more to the communication of the resulting stories: ensuring that the right story is told in the most effective way, or ways.

You may disagree with this list, or have other qualities that you think need adding. I'd love to hear those.

## 1. Curiosity - and imagination

*"Don't say you want to see the world and then complain if you're sent to Djibouti."*

One of the greatest appeals of journalism - the fact that you might be reporting on one thing today and a completely different thing tomorrow - is also sometimes the source of students' most common complaint: that a subject is not interesting.

The complaint is a symptom of bad habits: a symptom, specifically, of a lack of *curiosity*.

Good journalism starts with curiosity: a desire to learn about the world, to ask questions about how it works. It is also a result of an attempt to *imagine* what the results might be.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

Why is good journalism a result of curiosity? (Well done if you were asking that question: it shows you're already developing good habits!)

You can classify journalism into two categories: stories that *react* to events; and stories that *proactively* reveal or shine a spotlight on things that we need to know.

The second category of stories has its seed in curiosity: proactive journalism cannot exist without curiosity; it begins with a question: "What happens to sportspeople after they retire?"; "What is the council spending its money on?"; "Why don't we have a cure for cancer?"

But reactive reporting would also be much poorer if we were not curious, too.

Take a standard story: a car crash. This might begin with a statement from the local police force that a car crashed on a particular road at 11.15pm and the driver has been arrested.

An incurious reporter might simply publish those facts, and nothing else. There is a term for this process: **churnalism**: journalism which adds nothing, questions nothing, and merely republishes the information that has been provided from one source.

A curious reporter, however, would want to know more:

* What type of car was it?
* How did it crash? Did it leave the road, was it a collision with another car, or with some other obstacle?
* Why did it crash? Did the driver fall asleep? Were they distracted? Were they under the influence of alcohol or another substance? Was it someone else's fault? A problem with the road?
* Who was in the car? Was it just the driver?
* Was anybody else involved, either as participants or witnesses?
* Is the driver hurt? Anyone else?
* What has the driver been arrested for?
* Have they been charged? Released? When will the police need to decide one way or another?
* Is it rare or common for crashes to happen on this road?
* Where on the road did it take place?

You will notice that many of these questions fall into the '5 Ws and a H' often discussed in journalism:

* What?
* Who?
* Where?
* When?
* Why?
* How?

In fact the '5 Ws and a H' is a *method* to develop a habit of curiosity. Journalists starting out in their careers will list these questions and try to answer them in their reporting. More experienced journalists might do so without thinking: it has become a habit.

But there are other methods too: consider the role of **imagination** in the process above. The police have provided very little information, but we are already *imagining* parts of the story as a result. We might, for example, be already imagining that the driver was drunk. Why? Because the police have arrested the driver: we *assume* (imagine) that this means they believe that the driver has broken a law. Furthermore, we *imagine* that the most likely law in this context is going to be the one regarding drunk driving.

Reading such clues is useful, and important: it helps triggers the questions we might ask - but it can also be dangerous, and limiting. Not because imagination is bad, but because of a *failure of imagination*.

Consider the following other explanations for why the driver has been arrested:

* He was under the influence of drugs, not drink
* He wasn't wearing a seatbelt
* The car wasn't fit for the road
* He assaulted officers
* He was wanted for another, unrelated, crime

Here's another failure of imagination: the bullet points above have all used the word 'he'. Where did police say that this person was a *man*? Nowhere.

The more information provided, the more that our imagination will have to work with - but also the more limited. A particular make of car might lead us to make more assumptions about the events. What if the car was a black Porsche? A brown family saloon? A pink Volkswagen Beetle? A white VW Golf?

Curiosity and imagination help us to start asking questions - but there's a further habit we need to develop when listening to the answers...

## 2. Scepticism

When reporting a news event, do we only report what people tell us? What if two different sources say contrasting things?

Scepticism is important in journalism because it moves us from merely repeating what people have said, to establishing the *factual basis* for that information. It has become particularly important in a modern information age when most public bodies can communicate with the public directly, without that accountability.

If curiosity is where journalists act as the eyes and ears of the audience, scepticism is where we act as the mouth: it is the way in which we give a voice to an audience which isn't able to ask questions itself.

Scepticism is also another example of the journalist exercising their *imagination*: the sceptical journalist must always ask "But what if this information is not true?" - *what if*?

It is important to distinguish this from *cynicism*: the cynic *assumes* that they are being lied to; it is another *failure of imagination*, a failure to imagine that they are not being lied to. It is just as lazy as being credulous, where the person fails to imagine the opposite: that they are not being told the truth.

The sceptic, by contrast, is comfortable with the uncertainty of not knowing whether something is true or false. It is a difficult position for the journalist to occupy, because uncertainty is not welcomed in the newsroom or in the news report: we deal with facts.

How, then, does the newsroom handle uncertainty? Mainly with **attribution**: "police said"; "the MP for Rochdale said"; "a witness said". With no time to establish the veracity of these accounts, and a deadline looming, we can only report what was *said*, not what *happened*.

This is an important distinction to make, and one that trainee journalists learn: do not report what someone has said as fact, if you cannot establish it yourself. Establishing facts is not an exact science: in the example above the report might say that 'A man has been arrested following a crash on Chester Road' even though they have not observed the crash themselves, or seen the man in question. They would do so because they have no reason to believe the police would mislead them over such an innocuous event.

However, when dealing with other parts of the story, particularly those which may be subject to some debate in future, they might be more cautious: 'Police say the vehicle was travelling at over 50mph when it collided with another vehicle'. How do they know the vehicle was travelling that fast, or that it collided?

Scepticism allows us to make these decisions, but on its own it is not enough for great journalism: we must be able to pursue the facts that will allow us to better establish what the facts actually are; to move from 'not knowing' to 'knowing'. And that requires persistence.

## 3. Persistence

One of the earliest skills that broadcast journalists learn is how to conduct a *vox pop*. Short for *vox populi* (voice of the people) the vox pop is an attempt to 'take the pulse' of the public on a topical issue: the journalist will take up a position in a busy public place and ask passers-by to share their pearls of wisdom on the issue of the day.

The results will be used at the end of a news package (not, it should be pointed out, on its own), particularly when the news story in question doesn't have many other interviews or visuals to draw on. Most are quickly forgotten (the exception, perhaps the best known example of the form, is [Brenda from Bristol's reaction to the announcement of the 2017 snap general election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-IQAdFU3w): "You're joking - not ANOTHER ONE!")

Stand on a street corner with a microphone and an audio recorder, and ask people if they are prepared to be interviewed about a topical issue.

Most will refuse.

But this is the point: failure is part of journalism. When you try to speak to people, many will refuse to speak to you, and it is helpful to accept this from the start. 

## 4. Empathy

## 5. Creativity

## 6. Discipline

## 7. Adaptability

## All 7 habits work in tension with each other

Now that these have been listed, it is important to remember how each works in tension with the other:

A good journalist is **curious**, but not *credulous*: their **scepticism** helps prevent this. But scepticism should be distinguished from *cynicism*: a sceptical journalist develops the habit of **persistence** in establishing whether something is true or not. Persistence needs to be tempered by **empathy**: there is a world of difference between the journalist who exploits the vulnerability of sources, and the journalist who understands how best to ethically encourage a source's cooperation.

Equally, the **creative** reporter should not be *indulgent* with respect to that creativity; they need **discipline** to employ that creativity towards a journalistic objective, ensuring that their story is clear, coherent and appropriate to the target audience. But discipline does not mean *rigidity*: a modern journalist needs the **adaptability** to realise when the story they had in mind has changed, or that it needs to be told in a different way.
