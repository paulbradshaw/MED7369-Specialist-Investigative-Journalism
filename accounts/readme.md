# Using company accounts in stories

Company accounts can be a great source of stories, or a useful resource to provide extra context to a story that you are already working on. This folder contains material related to this part of the module.

## Potential stories from accounts

* Company/director says something newsworthy
* Conflicts of interest, abuse of power
* Context to news story (e.g. what did Grenfell Tower company say in their accounts)
* Problems and warning signs
* Staff cuts and problems
* Comparisons (between companies) and trends (over time)
* Money: tax, rising costs, profits, debt (jobs)


## Useful sites

* [Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/)
* [Charity Commission](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/)
* [Open Corporates](https://opencorporates.com/)
* The [Investigative Dashboard database of business registries](https://investigativedashboard.org/databases/topics/business) (and other databases)
* [OpenGazettes](http://opengazettes.com/)
* [Arachnys Compass](https://compass.arachnys.com)

## Exercises and ideas

* [Look at the return of payday loans by compiling data on the main companies' growth](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/paydayexercise.md)
* Pick an author or celebrity and write about how their company's income has changed over the years (e.g. [Fifty Shades Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07934674/filing-history))
* Look at the declarations of interest for people on a public body. Write an explainer along the lines of 'These are the companies that X have an interest in'. Check their accounts for **related party transactions**. Use public expenditure data, or data through FOI, to see if any of those companies have a commercial relationship with the organisation. Examples include:
  * [councillors](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/50069/councillors/285/councillors_interests/1), 
  * [MPs](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/), 
  * [Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-interests/register-of-lords-interests/), school governors, 
  * [members of a clinical commissioning group (CCG)](https://www.birminghamandsolihullccg.nhs.uk/about-us/register-of-interests), 
  * [police](http://foi.west-midlands.police.uk/publication-scheme/lists-and-registers/), 
  * The [police and crime commissioner](https://www.dorset.pcc.police.uk/information-hub/publication-scheme/lists-and-registers/) or other public bodies or representative). 
* There's an election coming up. Search for each candidate ([Democracy Club maintains a list](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/)) on Companies House to write a piece about their business interests. How do you know it's the same person? Check the address against the *Statement of Persons Nominated* (SOPN) for candidates in that area - there's a [list of links to each SOPN here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRdHm-DdpEh0meLB3DzZrkN8PfdLbQIMpEVDQUpxphg/edit#gid=0). Also look for other biographical details in the public domain.
* Pick a shopping hub such as the Bullring or a particular high street. Make a list of the shops in that location. Compile a spreadsheet showing what rate of tax each of the businesses *actually* paid in last year's accounts. Write a guide to how to shop in a way that supports businesses whose parent companies pay the most tax.
* Pick a sector which has been in the news. Use company accounts to identify how much the highest paid director received, and which company paid the most.
