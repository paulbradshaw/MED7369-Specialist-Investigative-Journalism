# Using company accounts in stories

Company accounts can be a great source of stories, or a useful resource to provide extra context to a story that you are already working on. This folder contains material related to this part of the module.

## Potential stories from accounts

* Company/director says something newsworthy
* Conflicts of interest, abuse of power
* Context to news story (e.g. what did Grenfell Tower company say in their accounts)
* Problems and warning signs
* Staff cuts and problems
* Comparisons (between companies) and trends (over time)
* Money: tax, rising costs, profits, debt (jobs)


## Useful sites

* [Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/)
* [Charity Commission](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/)
* [Open Corporates](https://opencorporates.com/)
* The [Investigative Dashboard database of business registries](https://investigativedashboard.org/databases/topics/business) (and other databases)
* [OpenGazettes](http://opengazettes.com/)
* [Arachnys Compass](https://compass.arachnys.com)

## Accounts in data format

As well as documents, some organisations provide accounts in formats that can be more easily queried and analysed, i.e. data. Here are some examples:

* [NHS Trusts accounts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-trusts-accounts-2016-to-2017)
* [Income and expenditure of academies and local authority maintained schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-local-authority-school-finance-data)
* Government department annual report and accounts: [e.g. DFID](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dfid-annual-report-and-accounts-2016-17)
* Local government (councils) also publish accounts ([here are the accounts for Birmingham City Council](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/20217/accounts/474/accounts)) and expenditure above £500 ([here is expenditure for Bradford](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/open-data/our-datasets/expenditure-greater-than-500-in-value/)). Gov.uk has a page on understanding how your council works which [includes a section on accounts](https://www.gov.uk/understand-how-your-council-works/spending-and-accounts). Each council allows the public to audit its accounts for a period every year - [dates have been collated here](https://github.com/bbc-data-unit/council-accounts) - while the NAO have published [a guide to your rights](https://www.nao.org.uk/code-audit-practice/council-accounts-a-guide-to-your-rights/#)
* A number of websites provides APIs which allow you to query companies house data to get it in a structured format. These include:
  * [Companies House](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/)
  * [OpenCorporates](http://api.opencorporates.com/)
  * [DueDil (£)](https://www.duedil.com/api)
* The Charity Commission also [has a data download](http://data.charitycommission.gov.uk/) and [an API](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/APIConsole/APIConsoleHome.aspx) while Olly Benson has created his own API [CharityData](https://olib.uk/charity/html/api)


## Exercises and ideas

* [Look at the return of payday loans by compiling data on the main companies' growth](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/paydayexercise.md)
* Pick an author or celebrity and write about **how their company's income has changed** over the years (e.g. [Fifty Shades Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07934674/filing-history))
* Look at the declarations of interest for people on a public body. Write an explainer along the lines of **'These are the companies that X have an interest in'**. Check their accounts for **related party transactions**. Use public expenditure data, or data through FOI, to see if any of those companies have a commercial relationship with the organisation. Examples include:
  * [councillors](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/info/50069/councillors/285/councillors_interests/1),
  * [MPs](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/),
  * [Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-interests/register-of-lords-interests/), school governors,
  * [members of a clinical commissioning group (CCG)](https://www.birminghamandsolihullccg.nhs.uk/about-us/register-of-interests),
  * [police](http://foi.west-midlands.police.uk/publication-scheme/lists-and-registers/),
  * The [police and crime commissioner](https://www.dorset.pcc.police.uk/information-hub/publication-scheme/lists-and-registers/) or other public bodies or representative). There's some [background to problems when it comes to PCC registers here, which may provide some useful context](http://library.college.police.uk/docs/pcc-register-of-interests-2013-to-14.pdf)
* There's an election coming up. Search for each candidate ([Democracy Club maintains a list](https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/)) on Companies House to write a piece about their business interests. How do you know it's the same person? Check the address against the *Statement of Persons Nominated* (SOPN) for candidates in that area - there's a [list of links to each SOPN here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRdHm-DdpEh0meLB3DzZrkN8PfdLbQIMpEVDQUpxphg/edit#gid=0). Also look for other biographical details in the public domain.
* Pick a shopping hub such as the Bullring or a particular high street. Make a list of the shops in that location. Compile a spreadsheet showing what rate of tax each of the businesses *actually* paid in last year's accounts. Write a guide to **how to shop in a way that supports businesses whose parent companies pay the most tax**.
* Pick a sector which has been in the news. Use company accounts to identify **how much the highest paid director received**, and which company paid the most.
* Pick a charity, or a company which is expected to be performing some sort of public good. Is it doing anything which you wouldn't expect? For example [Camelot UK Lotteries Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02822203/filing-history) - is it giving less and less to good causes?
* **Create an explainer mapping the network of companies surrounding one organisation or person**: for example who are all the [companies connected to Arsenal FC](https://embed.kumu.io/3471de53ff336a677855f153a766f46d)? Or [Radiohead](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/radiohead-corporate-structure-firms)? You'll often find a network of sister companies, parent companies, financing and business interests held by directors. **Use network analysis** to show the connections.
