# Investigations day

## Paul Myers

*Works for BBC Academy supporting staff in investigations, bringing in experts, e.g. information recovery*

Street View - in top right can use drop down to select a different period. E.g. https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Mailbox/@52.4756886,-1.9042143,3a,75y,330.07h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s79uLuHLxSo_amfceJpeCDw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x4870bc8ada73959d:0xa7185a7bcf13de19!8m2!3d52.4759253!4d-1.9050241

Previous owners of business - follow up domains, follow up phone numbers through search, Pipl.com

Use `site:facebook.com` operator to look for cached copies, e.g.

`"Marilou Danley" site:facebook.com`

Archive.org is banned from using Facebook - but [archive.today](https://archive.fo/) does - and it has a login for Facebook.

Whois service (domain registration details) details are now largely hidden due to GDPR.

But [DomainTools does have historical detail](https://research.domaintools.com/research/whois-history/) - but some options cost money, £1000 per year. Their [**Iris** tool](https://research.domaintools.com/iris/), for example, creates a network graph showing people, IP addresses and emails connected with a domain, or (more interesting) multiple domains.

Another option: [DomainBigData](https://domainbigdata.com/) to see what domains someone has registered (try ["Meghan Markle"](https://domainbigdata.com/nj/-IVZ2SlGMr4oQUDXovhVMA) then use DomainTools to find historical email address and phone number, then put that - rangosmermaid@icloud.com - into Pipl.com)

[Whoisology](https://whoisology.com/) is cheaper than DomainTools (and free for a certain number of searches) and also shows registrants and other domains registered by the same person or organisation.

### IP searches

**Reverse IP search**: example: Loveukbags.com is selling heavily discounted luxury brand handbags. DomainTools shows that it is hosted on a server in New Jersey but registered in China. The server (IP address) is shared by 50 domains in the same field, helping lead to other outlets that may be connected to the same company.

LinkedIn Chrome plugins will show you contact details of people who have accounts - e.g. [Lusha](https://www.lusha.co/) and [ContactOut](https://contactout.com/). These tend to use a freemium model. Once you find contact details look for them online in case you are asked how you got their phone number.

[Lexis Diligence](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-diligence.page) (free trial) allows you to do due diligence on individuals, including negative news, sanctions (PEP search - **Politically Exposed Person**) etc.

[Spokeo](https://www.spokeo.com/) is another people search tool. Use [Email Format](https://email-format.com/) to help you guess an email if you don't know it.

[HLR Lookups](https://www.hlr-lookups.com/) will trace mobile phones. Will tell you which country they are currently in.

[Truecaller](https://www.truecaller.com/) allows you to trace phone numbers, but since GDPR you may have trouble with EU phone numbers as it ditched millions of numbers post-GDPR.

### Facebook Graph searches

Example: **Studio 189** in Birmingham closed down as a brothel - Facebook page has reviews. Use graph search to find people who liked it. You will need to [find the page ID](https://findmyfbid.com/), then adapt the URL structure below:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/likers`

Or for those who have checked in:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/visitors`

For any photos:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/photos-of/intersect`

Or:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/photos-commented/intersect`

Or:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/stories-commented/intersect`

To find future events:

`facebook.com/search/IDNUMBER/events-joined`

[Stalkscan.com](https://stalkscan.com/) will generate searches for you.

[peoplefindThor](https://peoplefindthor.dk/) allows you to search by demographics.

Be aware that people sometimes like page to monitor them, not because they agree with them.

[Hidden friends can be found too](https://lifehacker.com/uncover-every-friend-on-someone-s-private-facebook-frie-1586250899). Find a friend of theirs who has an open friends list - combine their Facebook ID and the target ID into a graph URL.

### Twitter searches

[Tweetbeaver](https://tweetbeaver.com/) provides advanced search for Twitter including finding people's Twitter ID number (useful because it will always work regardless of their screen name if they change that), timezone, language (if set), and these details can be downloaded.

[Tweepsect](http://tweepsect.com/) will show mutual connections and [Followerwonk](https://moz.com/followerwonk) will also show accounts that both target accounts follow and analyse where followers are based. The times that they post can give us a clue to which timezone they are based in.

## LinkedIn for journalists: James Upsher

*James Upsher, Corporate Communicators Officer - connect to get free account, and renew after a year.*

You see updates about 2nd and 3rd tier connections, so it's worth building a large network to be able to see as many as possible.

See your connections at [https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/](https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/)

Uses of LinkedIn for journalists:

* Ask for introductions
* Ask questions of your network

**[Profile viewing options](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/)** allow you to switch to a **Private mode** when looking at other profiles so others don't know you looked: find this on the homepage, upper right after clicking *[Who's viewed my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/me/profile-views/urn:li:wvmp:summary/)*

### Advanced search

*Clear any filters across the top first*

Search for name then open advanced filters, specify company, language, connection level, etc.

Search for company first, then use advanced search to find people in sections.

**People who did work in a company**: again under advanced search - **Past companies** but *also* set **Current companies** to a different company to exclude those still at the company in a new role. Example: [Commons Speaker John Bercow accused of bullying private secretary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43963788)

**Alerts**: after doing a search on the right there is a *Create alert* option to be notified when someone matches your search.

**InMail** gives you 15 credits but these are refunded whenever someone replies, so can keep being used as long as you're not spamming.

**Areas of industry expansion or reduction**: Search for a keyword (e.g. blockchain) then switch search from *People* to *Jobs*. Create job alert to continue being notified. (Could have been used for Jane Haynes's internships story). Examples: [Apple Is On The Hunt For Medical Tech Talent](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/apple-is-ramping-up-its-medical-tech-workforce?utm_term=.ooj8Neg8m#.cqP5ZKk5R) by BuzzFeed, or [iPhone supplier Dialog is losing staff to Apple](http://uk.businessinsider.com/iphone-supplier-dialog-is-losing-staff-to-apple-2017-12)

**Company pages** include extra insights on Pro account, such as staff numbers ([try Bell Pottinger](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bell-pottinger-group/)) and new hires (try Carillion - note they stopped hiring from October, months before they went bust) - perhaps [Oxfam](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oxfam/) would be another one.

**Boolean search**

You can use these operators to limit your searches:

* firstname:
* lastname:
* title:
* company:
* school:
* NOT, AND, OR

**Groups**: find experts, e.g. 'Tall buildings fire safety' (select *Groups*). You can see who has created the group even if it's private, and approach them.

Make sure your profile has examples of your work to make sources more likely to contact you. The profile of Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, for example, made it possible for him to [expose the Theranos scam](https://www.theringer.com/2018/5/22/17378494/bad-blood-theranos-john-carreyrou-interview)



## Undercover reporting

You are basically committing a crime in order to expose a bigger crime.

Biggest task is finding and training the people who are going to go undercover (example posing as students for international visa). We were looking for students who had a real passport and were plausible in terms of qualifications, other aspects of the story, etc.

You have to have evidence of wrongdoing first.

Have to get it checked off by editors, EdPol, and other senior people (deputy director of current affairs/controller of English Regions).

You need to plan carefully:

* Evidence you need to get
* Safety
* What you do if things go wrong
* How are you going to get them out if needed (how will they contact you if they're not comfortable) - "we had a text protocol"
* Safe place to start, close enough to target building but not so close that you are rumbled

You are expected to disclose crime to police "Within a reasonable amount of time". That will depend on the crime and likelihood of further crime, etc. - an editorial and legal/ethical discussion/decision.

Engage with BBC High Risk and talk through plan.

May have to give evidence at trial. May receive a **production order** from police to share film.

### Considerations:

Scenario 1: Students paying for someone else to do English language test

* Identification
* Discovery (e.g. kit)
* How far you push subject (incitement, conspiracy etc.) - witness with as little direct encouragement as possible
* Don't comment on camera as long as it's filming (even after leaving), in case rushes are requested
* Debrief after camera is turned off, but...
* Keep very good records

Scenario 2: Mosque where radicalisation is taking place.

* Very tough laws around this issue which need considering first (including duty to disclose)
* Consider position on production order - after filming has finished?
* Lawyers may advise that some information you will be obliged to disclose to authorities, so may be details you do not ask for to avoid that scenario

## Football finances - Northamptonshire

Council gave £10m to Northampton Town for stadium but workers walked off site when money ran out.

Council gave money to SPV owned by businessman. First Land, owned by Harold Grossman.

Council leader was David Macintosh who went on to become Tory MP

One of co-founders of SPV involved in other companies involved in nefarious stuff. But discovered he's a nominee director who just gets added to companies.

Tip off - look at electoral commission website and donors to David Macintosh. 3 of the donors were the names of individuals related to the SPV. They were proxy donors from Harold Grossman.

So we'd established 3 bogus donations, breaking donation rules. That was one story.

On course for court case between council and First Land.

£1m from money went on 'consultancy fees'.

Obtained documents from High Court - duplicated them - so we could use them in our reporting, covered by qualified privilege.

Second big story (Inside Out) was a narrative of what had happened to the money, and this High Court case.

When First Land went into administration documents lodged at Companies House mentioned money had been used to improve his house.

We found a whistleblower who had worked for Grossman on unrelated projects, but had been asked to send his invoices to Northamptonshire Council. We were able to run a story on that, and that he had warned Macintosh. Asked council if they knew - no.

Where did the £10,000 donations come from? We had a hypothesis they'd come from First Land. Went to the  administrator, biggest creditor who has access to the accounts, we asked if that money had gone through the accounts and they said 'yes'. A tiny fraction of their funding came from another source so we couldn't definitively say the council money had paid for the election donations.

Election agent (relations within the local Conservative party having turned sour) shared accounts showing other payments - we searched names on Companies House, Land Registry, and connected them with Grossman. These put him over threshold for declarations. .

Bury, Swindon and Portsmouth and Port Vale also came up.
