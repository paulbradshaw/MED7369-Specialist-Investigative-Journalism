# Where's the story? Combining data-driven journalism with people-centred reporting

The data isn't the story — the *people* are: often we are using data to find out about the systems that people are affected by, the scale of a problem, or shine a light on particular individuals. This workshop focuses on techniques for finding the human stories that help bring the numbers to life, from scoping the characters and settings that can help inject movement into your story, to tips on finding and interviewing key sources. Finally, the workshop outlines techniques for combining data and interviews in longer narrative formats.

## What's the problem?

> "The classic inverted-pyramid news story ... became a habit with many news reporters who rarely gave a second thought to the subject of writing. Unfortunately, they are now ill prepared for what is happening in print media." - James B. Stewart, Follow The Story

## Mapping the territory: finding story angles

Pick a subject, and map...

* What characters (or types) are there?
* What settings?
* What movement? (conflict, needs, wants, physical, emotional)

Movement happens through time (events), space (settings) and characters (change of person, change of opinion).

## People: finding them, understanding them

## Putting the pieces together: narrative techniques

James B. Stewart's book *Follow The Story* identifies the following key elements of a story:

* The lead (or lede)
* The transition (sometimes, but not always, a 'nut graf')
* The core structure
* The ending (divided into: climax and denouement; summation; anecdote; hybrid)

### Transitions and nut grafs

Stewart warns against nut grafs that "crush" the story by giving too much away. He advises a good nut graf should:

* Never give away the ending of a story
* Never state the conclusion of a story
* Foreshadow, but do not make explicit, the broader themes in a story
* Anticipate the questions a reader might be asking early in a story, and address them
* Give readers a concrete reason or reasons to read on

For these reasons he advises writing the nut graf last, so the natural structure of the story can be created without it getting in the way.

### Structure

Chronology is an obvious organising principle, particularly when following the reporter's 'quest'. It is the most basic tool that is used to inject movement into a story: this happened, and then that happened, and then another thing happened. It is a movement from distant past to recent past, to present, and even to a potential future.

In this respect when interviewing sources it is important to distinguish between *perceptions and memories*, which relate to the present, and "*events, dialogue and states of mind* that existed in the past" (Stewart, my emphasis).

This is why I advise my students to, on the whole, avoid asking people what they 'think'; asking what they *did*, or *will do* is much more concrete: it not only gives us hard facts to check and hold people to account over, but takes us into the past and future, introducing a narrative dimension. Even asking people what they *thought* (in the past) is preferable, because this allows us to show movement or stasis: those thoughts have either changed (they were misled or misinformed or the facts changed), or they have stayed the same (nothing has changed when it should; a person is stubbornly refusing to change their opinion in response to the facts).

### Temporality

The **temporality** of a story refers to this use of time; elements of temporality include:

* Its **time frame** (the range between the earliest and latest events depicted)
* Its **pacing**: "The relationship between a duration (story events) and length (text/etc)"
 (real time, slow motion, hyperlapse). Typically this is faster towards the end of a story to create momentum (and partly because all the key ingredients have been introduced by then).
* **Direction** (forwards, backwards, back-and-forth) among other elements.

### Narrative point of view

The journalist must choose which perspective different parts of the story are being written from. This is often different to traditional short news reports where the reporters is invisible - in a longer feature the reporter might be front-and-centre as a narrative device to drive the story forward (their 'quest' is the structure).

But a story might also adopt or switch to other perspectives too - in fact, switching perspectives is one way of injecting movement into a story.

Perspectives can help us to understand the *source* of information. When a scene is described from the point of view of a particular character - we are describing what they were feeling at the time, what they saw, what they thought - then we are not only inviting the reader to see events from their point of view but implying that the description of those events *come from* that person and are coloured by that perspective (and feelings, etc.).

A distinction should be made here where some of those things are described by a third party, but we are still seeing things through *their* eyes ("Paul told me he was feeling tired, and moved to his bed").

All stories have a perspective and even the 'view from nowhere' is a device which has its criticisms. Whichever you choose, you should consider the issues that perspective raises, and how to address those if necessary.

For example, if you are relying on one person's description of events you might need to mention any motivations that the reader needs to bear in mind in judging its credibility; you might talk about how you came across this information; you might talk about other sources that corroborate or contradict this; you might acknowledge the impossibility or difficulty of corroborating particular claims.

Indeed, if there is contradiction or confusion this can be used effectively as a way of introducing narrative tension into your story. Unreliable narrators have enjoyed a certain fashionability in fiction in recent years, which means readers are more used to this, and in journalism it is important to help readers to be skeptical and understand their own cognitive biases, so a story in which the reader is invited to experience one retelling of events before it is 'revealed' that this version is untrustworthy can be important.

Point of view can alter chronology: while events might happen in a certain sequence when seen from the point of view of those directly involved, the same events can be *learned about* in a different sequence when seen from other points of view: the head of a murder investigation, for example, might only learn about events that occurred before the murder, after they learned of the murder itself, and that sequence might be more appropriate when telling the story of the investigation.

Likewise, we might follow a story from one person's point of view from time A to now, then move to another point of view back and time A and follow that different person's journey from that point to now.

### Settings

Settings are the third way of injecting movement into a story, as we 'cut' from one to another. They introduce a concreteness to your story which is important, and also serve to add extra important contextual information (19th century fiction used lengthy descriptions of settings to provide important clues about the characters that occupied them).

However, too many settings can make a story tiring or confusing, especially if you are also moving between characters and/or time periods. For that reason they should be used carefully - always ask whether the information conveyed within one particular setting can be conveyed in another scene in a setting that's already familiar to the reader (notably, James B. Stewart advises those writing their first longform stories to stick to one setting and one point of view, and use chronology as the driving force, before experimenting with multiple settings and/or points of view).
