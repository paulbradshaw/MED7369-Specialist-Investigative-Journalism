    "# Introduction to Python and Morph.io (for scraping)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to build on some basic coding concepts and introduce Morph.io. By the end you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to use GitHub to edit Python files\n",
    "* Use Morph.io to run Python code hosted on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get started with Morph.io\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/) if you haven't got one already, and [sign in to Morph.io using your GitHub account](https://morph.io/users/auth/github)\n",
    "2. [Click **New scraper**](https://morph.io/scrapers/new) on the menu at the top of Morph.io. You will be taken to a new page asking you to specify more details\n",
    "3. On the dropdown menu for *Language*, select **Python**. Give your scraper a name in the next box - something like 'startingtocode' (no spaces), and in the final box write 'none' - this isn't a scraper yet: we're just using Morph.io as a place to learn code.\n",
    "4. Click **Create scraper**\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take Morph.io a few moments to create the files for your scraper (the files are being created on GitHub). \n",
    "\n",
    "When it has finished, you will be taken to a new page for the scraper. Look on the right where it says *Scraper code*. There should be a link to `startingtocode / scraper.py ` - this will take you to the pages on GitHub where the code is now hosted: `scraper.py` is the file for the code itself; `startingtocode` is the link to the repository containing that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the link to `scraper.py` in a separate tab or window, but also keep your Morph.io page for this scraper open in another tab or window - you will need to edit the code on GitHub, and run it to see the results on Morph.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the template code\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new scraper on Morph.io, it creates it with some template code as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line begins with a hash symbol: `#`. There are two ways that these are most commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Firstly, as a way of creating **comments** in Python code: any code starting with a `#` does not do anything, so the hash symbol allows you to add comments which are not treated as working code.\n",
    "* Secondly, as a way of *disabling* code - what's called *commenting out* code. Rather than delete an entire line of code, it is easier to add a `#` at the front to turn it 'off' to test what happens, so you can always turn it back 'on' again quickly by removing the `#`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the template code below generated by Morph.io, the *entire* code is commented out. The idea is that you can **uncomment** the sections you want to use in your own code, saving you time writing scraping code from scratch. We'll come back to this later."
