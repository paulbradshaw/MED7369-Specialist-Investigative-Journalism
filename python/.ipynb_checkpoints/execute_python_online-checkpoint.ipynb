    "This tutorial is intended to get you started with coding in Python. By the end you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to use basic commands like `print` to see what the code is doing\n",
    "* Explain coding concepts like variables, loops and if/else tests - and explain how those can be used in journalistic applications like scraping\n",
    "* Identify different types of data: numerical (integers and floats), text (strings), lists and dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming environments\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python you need to be using a computer on which Python has been installed. There are two ways of doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a web-based environment which allows you to run Python on a remote computer where it is already installed\n",
    "* Install Python on your own computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do the latter is to [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). This not only installs Python but also useful tools like **Jupyter Notebook** (a way of making your code accessible to others - you are reading a notebook right now) and **Spyder** (a coding 'environment' that allows you to see what you're working with, similar to RStudio). [You can find a video tutorial on installing Python and Jupyter Notebook here](https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Installing-Python-Jupyter-Notebook/576698/605448-4.html). If you are studying the MA Data Journalism, this is well worth doing. \n",

    "Web-based environments include [Execute Python Online](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/executepythononline.md), [Try Jupyter](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/tryjupyter.md) (a good way to get used to notebooks - but code is stored only temporarily), [PythonAnywhere](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/pythonanywhere.md), [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) (which could be a way to allow people to play with your code as you can embed both code and results in an iframe), and [Repl.it](https://repl.it/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we are going to start with [Execute Python Online website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php) to build some basic understanding, before using [Morph.io](https://morph.io/) to start to write scrapers.\n",

    "The website screen is split into 3 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The upper left corner shows the file directory. Ignore this: you won't need it.\n",
    "* The upper right corner is where you write your code. Above it are buttons to 'execute' that code, etc.\n",
    "* The bottom half of the screen shows you what *output* is generated when you execute the code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code window already has two lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hello World program in Python\n",
    "print \"Hello World!\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is a **comment**. Comments start with a hash symbol (`#`) and do not do anything, apart from describe what comes after. They are useful for explaining what the code is doing, both for others and for yourself when you return to it later. They can also be used to turn code 'off' temporarily by 'commenting out' a line of code (the line can then be turned back 'on' by removing the comment, or 'uncommenting').\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line is a **print** command. The word `print` tells Python to *display* anything that comes after it. In this case, a **string** of text: `\"Hello World!\\n\"`\n",
