A typical example would be the user's name: in a piece of programming you might want to ask the user for their name, and then store it somehow to use later (in a welcome message, or a result at the end, for example). \n",

    "\n",
    "If you've ever written a spreadsheet formula that uses a cell reference like A2 or C10 then you've already used a form of variable: a formula like `A2*10` can different results depending on the value in A2 - and is more flexible: instead of having to type a new formula each time you want to multiply a number by 10, you only have to change one thing: the value in A2.\n",

    "Now we look at the function as we defined it above. In the line `def myagetest(userage):` that ingredient is given the name `userage`. In other words, `22` is stored in a variable called `userage`, which can then be used by the code inside the function. \n",

    "This is what's called a **local variable**. In other words, it only exists within the scope of the function itself. Once the function is finished, the variable no longer exists. \n",
