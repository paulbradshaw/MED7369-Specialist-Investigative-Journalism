# Python

This folder contains some resources to get you started with Python.

* First, [read the guide to getting used to basic programming concepts by using Execute Python Online](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/execute_python_online.ipynb)
* Second, move on to [this guide to some lines of code you can use to interact with an API](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/executepythononline.md)
* Next, you can switch to Morph.io and [this guide to using it for scraping](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/1introtopython.ipynb) or [this guide to using it with an API](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/morphio.md)
* As a student on the MA at Birmingham City University, you have access to a free copy of [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists). Look for the special link on Moodle!
* I have some [more stuff on Python in a dedicated repo](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo)

## Python notebooks

One good to way to use Python on your computer - while also building the habit of making notes for yourself and for your audiences - is a Jupyter notebook.
